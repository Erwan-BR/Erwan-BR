# 👋 Welcome to my GitHub profile! 👋

## 🕵️ Who am I ? 🕵️
I'm Erwan BROUDIN, a student in my final year of engineering school (Master's degree) at ENSEA, in France.

I specialize in development (C, C++, Python, Java, Javascript, ...), and I also have skills in electronics. I'm someone who likes to learn new things, and quickly, and I'm constantly training myself to develop new skills as well as deepen the ones I already have.

## 🔍 What am I looking for ? 🔍
I'm currently looking for an internship outside France, lasting 5 to 6 months and starting as soon as possible, in order to complete my studies with an engineering internship that will also enable me to discover the international development profession!

## 🔭 What am I working on at the moment ? 🔭
 I'm currently working on adapting a board game into a video game, which you can find on [this repository](https://github.com/Erwan-BR/PLT).

 I'm also about to start work on a project for interactive visualization of different sorting algorithms in C++ using a graphics library, most likely SFML.

## 🌱 What am I learning ? 🌱

I'm currently learning new ways of working in c++ thanks to Leetcode ([my profile](https://leetcode.com/Erwan-Br/)), and how to make code solutions more efficient. I'm always on the lookout to learn new skills, which is what prompted me to create a website to introduce myself and learn HTML / CSS that I'd never seen before ((my website)[https://erwanbroudin.com]).
